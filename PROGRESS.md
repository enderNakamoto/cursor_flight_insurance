## 🔄 Current Status

**Stage:** Stage 1 - Foundation & Setup (95% Complete)
**Next Priority:** Complete remaining Stage 1 tasks and begin Stage 2

### Remaining Stage 1 Tasks
- [ ] Configure development tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Configure linting rules

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Stage 1 Completion)
1. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky
2. Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
3. Finalize Stage 1 documentation

### Stage 2: Core Smart Contracts
1. Implement `FlightInsurance.sol` controller contract
2. Create `RiskVault.sol` (ERC4626) for capital providers
3. Build `HedgeVault.sol` for per-flight insurance backing
4. Add USDC integration and approval mechanisms
5. Implement capital ratio enforcement (4:1 requirement)
6. Create policy management and expiration logic
7. Add comprehensive test suite
8. Deploy to Base testnet
